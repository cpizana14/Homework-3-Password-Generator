# Homework-3-Password-Generator
Password Generator

This page will generate a password out of different numbers, letter, and special characters.


The page will ask a question on how many characters you'd like, it must be between 8 and 128 characters long, and then it will ask if you'd like lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special charcters.
